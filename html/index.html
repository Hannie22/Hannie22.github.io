    <h2>MY RESEARCH</h2>
    <h3>‚úø about me and what I did research about...</h3>

    <p> Yup, it is true that I am a design student, coding has never been in my dictionary. However, to be an all-rounded UI UX designer, I think it is essential to learn about web design, web development, or anything related to code as it will be a huge benefit in my career path. </p>
    <p>Since everything is new to me, I did quite a lot of research about this field. As far as I know, the developer will be the one who builds a website/ application by using coding languages, otherwise, the designer gives that application "a beautiful face" to attract potential users. The solid connection between the developer and designer is undeniable, but somehow, to work professionally, they have to put themselves in the other's shoes to know how to make effective communication and reasonable compromise. That is mostly the reason why I choose to break out of my shell and enter the world of developers.</p>
    <p>The most interesting thing that I found out is there are many comparisons between designers and developers and this meme is the funniest lol. </p>

    <h2>MY RESPONSE</h2>
    <h3> ‚úø it is hard to transform my thought into text...</h3>

    <p>The website created by justin nguyen nguyen and Tiger Dingsun is the webite that I choose to sresearch, because this website converges 3 elements that I am interested in: music, fonts and colors. </p>

    <img src="./image/7 poems.png" width="1504px" alt="website">


    <p> <i> <u>1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience? </u></i> </p>
    <p>The combination of green and yellow colors definitely capture my eye at the first glance, I really want to give the web builder a big praise for his decision in choosing colors. The background color and the color of the elements mix together very well and give me a comfortable feeling. Followed by the visual style, which is minimalism. It is simple, and clean but still intrigues the viewer at some points. Again, I really like the way use 2 colors and the layout is separated into each part clearly without any overlapping elements. </p>
    <p> <i> <u>2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions. (with emotion included) </u></i></p>
    <p>
      - I looked through the page in the direction from left to right (curiosity, interesting). <br> 
      - I saw the text ‚Äúmute‚Äù so I instinctively turn on my volume. <br>
      - I clicked the rectangle below the text ‚Äúthe beetle‚Äù first, then I randomly clicked the others (surprise). <br>
      - Hearing the sound come from those boxes, I was wondering why there aren't any voices  (questioning). <br>
      - I kept finding ways to hear the voices, but it was simply instrumental music. (quite boring). <br>
      - After the text is all opened up, I closed it but failed at the first attempt (I clicked the box again in the hope that the music will end) (quite frustrated). <br>
      - I gradually understand how this website work, I played along with the music for a bit (enjoyed it). <br>
      - I clicked the title to close all the boxes and finished my interaction experience.

      <p> <i> <u>4.What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</u></i></p>
      <p>I spent about 2 minutes ticking the available boxes and listening to the sound being emitted. I stopped at each box and guessed the connection between the letters and the musical notes. And I realized that when the rectangular boxes turned green when the audio was stopped, each word would default to a separate audio track and each box would be a verse played in the background. music is available. Actually realizing this took a lot of my time because no instructions were given so I had to find out, wait and listen myself.</p>
      
      <p> <i> <u> 4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</u></i></p>
      <p>it's probably still a click, except it's nothing else because dragging and dropping or long pressing won't get me to the desired result.</p>
      
      <p> <i> <u> 5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience? </u></i></p>
      <p>I did few research about the owner to know how and why he make this website. To play around with text in a way that conveys different degrees of meaning, Tiger Dingsun - A Portland web developer has created ‚ÄúReading Machine '' - a flatform for non-teleological reading. ‚Äú7 poems‚Äù is one of the page in that website. As Tiger said he found it interesting how both poets and graphic designers are using language in aesthetic ways, to emulate difficult-to-express emotions. For me, poetry and design both try to create a world where words and sounds are the only thing existing.</p>

      <p> <i> <u>6. What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</u></i></p>
      <p>Tiger employs this structure as a means of inspiring readers to approach the material in a non-linear way. He, perhaps, wanted to show that word is an interactive elements itself, so that when people interact with those elements, they have to change their perspective in reading. </p>

      <p> <i> <u> 7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times) </u></i></p>
      <p>I think 2 minutes is enough for users to experience this interaction. That total will include their first experience of the app, second experience and failure at several steps, and a third experience as they understand the usage and intent of the web builder.</p>

      <p> <i> <u> 8. What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?</u></i></p>
      <p> this is very ambiguous question, I donnot get what is the expected answer </p>

      <p><i><u>9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference? </u></i></p>
      <p>Media forms inclued: animation text, music. </p>

      <p> <i> <u> 10. What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?</u></i></p>
      <p> 
        - overcliking the boxes <br>
        - hovering the page. </p>

      <p> <i> <u> 11. What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it? </u></i></p>
      <p> The feelings will be playful and funny. </p>

      <p> <u> <i> 12. What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?</i></u></p>
      <p>the nonstop sound => make my head gets dizzy </p>

      <p> <u> <i> 13. What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?</i></u></p>
      <p> music box - manually </p>
