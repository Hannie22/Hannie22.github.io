          <p>"Sometimes" is a computer-based interactive website that allows users to see every direction of text and encourage them to interact with it to receive information. The playful text and the diversity of color are created with the hope to bring curious and exciting feelings while the users hover over each text box.

          <p> Sometimes is starting phrase, following is the thought and facts about me and my friends that I have experienced and collected. Occupied by a heavy load from work and study, there will be a time when you stop worrying about everything and think about what deep down in your heart want to say. This is not happening “always” - it just happens “sometimes”
          </p>

          <p>The website of mine is hugely inspired by the time machine of Tiger Dingsun, as a designer, I never stop immersed in the wonderful text and its usability in our life. When interacting with Tiger Dingsun's website, I was extremely impressed with the way he let users play along with the text, at that time, I decide I want to make something like this and here we are today. 
          </p>

          <p> The font is gathered from <a href="https://www.dafontvn.com/">Dafontvn.com</a> and <a href="https://www.cufonfonts.com/"> Cufonfonts.com,</a> the color is combined manually by me, and the # of colors is taken from <a href="https://coolors.co/palettes/trending">Coolors.com</a>. Every text box has its own direction, which takes me a huge amount of time to make. I mostly use CSS to make those interactions, especially the hover, animation, and transition properties. The arrangement text-box is created by grid, I do it in no particular order to enhance the playful principle.
